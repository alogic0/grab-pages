# grab-pages
[Tagsoup](https://github.com/ndmitchell/tagsoup) is a simple and beautifull Haskell library for parsing HTML. Espessially I like its ability to create a tree of tags where you can remove unnecessary `div` branches. Add then whatever you want, render (or render and add raw html-code) and you will get page looking as you like.

In this repostitory I'll put my scripts for extracting content and transforming view of some pages.
